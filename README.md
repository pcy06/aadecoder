# aadecoder
Simply decodes the javascript code encoded by aaencode.

aaencode is not safe at all. It exposes all variable names and even comments. use another obfuscator if you don't want to show your javascript code to users.

## Usage
1. save your aaencoded code to input.js.
2. run aadecoder with:
```node index.js```
3. find out your decoded code written in output.js.
